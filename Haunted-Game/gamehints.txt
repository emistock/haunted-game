Game Cheats:

1. You must find the flashlight in order to see the game maps, otherwise you are
playing in the dark. If you throw the flashlight at a monster, there is a 50%
chance of the flashlight breaking (the flashlight does no damage to the monster).

2. There is 20% chance of a monster attack on a normal tile, and a 50% chance of
a monster attack on an item tile.

                                    |             |

                   Bedroom <--> Main Hall (START)

                      +
                    Bath

4. The Bedroom contains a key that can be used to open the study. You must
obtain the rope and use it on the railing of the patio in order to escape and
win the game.

5. After 1000 game movements, the reaper will kill the player if they have not
yet escaped or been killed by monsters.

6. Certain items can be used as protection against monsters. A knife (found in
the kitchen) allows the player to attack the monster and possibly not take any
damage. The towel (found in the bathroom) makes the monsters think the player is
a ghost, so they leave the player alone. A helmet, when used, will boost the
player’s defense against monsters by giving them armor.

7. The bowl of candy in the living room can be used to restore health
(it is not added to the player’s item list), but the apple is poisonous and will
immediately kill the player.
